# Loan Amount Prediction

This project aims to predict the loan amount for customers based on their profiles using machine learning algorithms. By analyzing various features, the model provides insights into how different factors influence loan eligibility and amount.

---

## Project Overview

The loan prediction model leverages a dataset containing customer details to forecast the loan amount they are eligible to receive. Key features include:
- Applicant income
- Credit score
- Loan history
- Employment status

---

## Technologies Used

- **Python**
- **Pandas** and **NumPy**: For data manipulation and preprocessing
- **Scikit-learn**: For building and evaluating machine learning models
- **Streamlit**: For creating an interactive web application to deploy the model

---

## Key Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Handled missing values and performed feature scaling to prepare the dataset for modeling.
- **Model Training**: Employed various algorithms, including Support Vector Classifier and Logistic Regression, to predict loan amounts.
- **Model Evaluation**: Evaluated model performance using metrics such as accuracy, confusion matrix, and ROC curve.
- **Web App Deployment**: Developed an interactive user interface using Streamlit, allowing users to input their details and receive loan amount predictions.
