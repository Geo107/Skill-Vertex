## 1. Iris Flower Prediction

### Description:
This project involves classifying the species of iris flowers using machine learning algorithms based on the famous Iris dataset. The dataset contains features such as sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.

### Technologies Used:
- **Pandas** for data manipulation
- **Scikit-learn** for model training (Logistic Regression, KNN, Random Forest Classifier)
- **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** for data visualization
- **Streamlit** for creating an interactive user interface

### Key Features:
- Trained and tested models to predict the species of iris flowers
- Deployed the model with an interactive web app using Streamlit

## 2. Loan Mount Prediction

### Description:
This project focuses on predicting loan amounts for customers based on their profiles using machine learning. The dataset includes features like income, loan history, and credit score, helping determine the loan amount a customer is eligible for.

### Technologies Used:
- **Pandas**, **NumPy** for data preprocessing
- **Scikit-learn** for model training (Support Vector Classifier, Logistic Regression)
- **Streamlit** for user interface and model deployment

### Key Features:
- Implemented data preprocessing steps including handling missing values and outlier detection
- Built a prediction model to estimate loan amounts and deployed it using Streamlit

## 3. Customer Churn Modelling (Telecom Sector)

### Description:
This project involves building a model to predict customer churn in the telecom sector. The model predicts whether a customer is likely to leave the service provider based on features such as monthly charges, tenure, and usage patterns.

### Technologies Used:
- **Pandas**, **NumPy** for data manipulation
- **Scikit-learn** for model training (Logistic Regression, KNN, Neural Network)
- **Streamlit** for creating a user-friendly interface

### Key Features:
- Trained a classification model to predict customer churn
- Integrated the model into a web application using Streamlit for user interaction
